*Modeling Visual Memorability Assessment with Autoencoders Reveals Characteristics of Memorable Images*  
üìÑ [arXiv:2410.15235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15235)

We introduce an unsupervised deep learning framework based on convolutional autoencoders to investigate the visual and structural features that make images memorable. Trained under a single-exposure setting to simulate human memory experiments, the model captures image representations that reveal how distinctiveness and reconstruction difficulty relate to memorability. We further leverage explainable AI to interpret these findings and explore the cognitive underpinnings of memory encoding.

Our approach departs from traditional supervised memorability prediction by modeling the phenomenon through **reconstruction dynamics**, **latent space distinctiveness**, and **feature-level analysis**‚Äîwithout requiring labeled training data.

### Key components of this work include:

- **Fine-tuning a convolutional autoencoder** (based on VGG16), pretrained on ImageNet, using the MemCat dataset to mimic single-exposure human memory conditions  
- **Analyzing reconstruction error and latent space distinctiveness**, hypothesizing that harder-to-reconstruct and more distinctive images are more memorable  
- **Predicting memorability using deep neural networks (MLPs)** trained on high-level latent representations extracted from the autoencoder  
- **Interpreting memorability predictions** using Integrated Gradients to identify spatially salient regions responsible for memorability outcomes  
- **Feature analysis using a rich set of visual and semantic descriptors** to quantify what makes images memorable:
  - **Scene composition and object richness**, extracted via pre-trained object detection (Faster R-CNN) and semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3) models  
  - **Color statistics** from LAB and HSV color spaces, including saturation, chromatic contrast (A/B channels), and **color diversity** via Shannon entropy  
  - **Texture and structural complexity**, measured through image entropy, GLCM-based **texture energy**, and **clutter scores** based on Canny edge detection  
  - Correlating these features with both **memorability scores** and **Integrated Gradient attributions** reveals how **scene complexity**, **visual saliency**, and **foreground-background separation** drive memory encoding  

This work provides computational insights into **visual memorability mechanisms** and offers practical tools for identifying or generating high-memorability images in real-world settings. The proposed **unsupervised framework** supports applications in **content creation, education, advertising, media, and visual communication**, enabling the generation of memorable visual content *without relying on large-scale labeled datasets*.
